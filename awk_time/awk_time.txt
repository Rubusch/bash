convert time in us:
  starting from 1900 ---> starting from unix epoch/1970:
  awk 'BEGIN(print strftime("%Y-%m-%d",1126884183))'

e.g.
  grep se.exec_start -r /proc/self/sched | awk '{print strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}'

get execution time of self call using 'sed'
$ sed -rn '\|se.exec_start| s|.*:\s+([0-9]+)\.[0-9]+|\1|p' /proc/self/sched

-r                      turn on extended regex mode
-n                      don't print every line.

\|se.exec_start|        match only lines containing "se.exec_start". The address
                        pattern traditionally uses /string/, but you can change
                        it to a different character by preceding it with a
                        backslash.

s|x|y|                  the standard sed substitution pattern. Again, it's
                        traditionally s/x/y/, but any basic ascii character can
                        be used.

.*:\s+                  a string of any kind of character, ending with ":" and
                        one or several whitespaces "\s"

([0-9]+)                capture one or more numbers, this may also include a
                        '.', but...

\.[0-9]+                ...here we only want to capture UNTIL the "\.", so this
                        is the trailing pattern

\1                      insert the captured part into the output string

p                       print the results
