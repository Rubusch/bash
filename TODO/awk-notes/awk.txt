awk notes

call awk (some changes)
        awk [awkscript] [inputfile]

        or (without the [ ] )
        awk '[expression] {[program]}' file

flags
        -F
        set field separator

        -f
        use a awk script: awk -f [programfile] [inputfile]




tables - the print command
        columns are named (starting with 1):
        $1, $2, $3, ...
        e.g. ls -l | awk '{ print $5 $9 }'

formatting fields
        [output] | awk '{ print "foo-text" $3 "bar-text" $5 }'


examples:
        - list 'ls' output modified:
        ls -ldh * | grep -v total | \
        awk '{ print "Size of " $5 " bytes for " $8 }'

        ls -lh *
        lists folders and content, this is not exactly
        what is printed out here!

        - print the free space modified:
        df -h | awk '/dev\/hd/ { print $6 "\t: " $5 }'

        - print everything ending with .txt
        ls -l | awk '/.*\.txt$/ { print $8 }'

        - print everything starting with 'a' or 'o' and ending with .txt
        ls -l | awk '/<[a|o].*\.txt$/ { print $8 }'

        print last element of a line, separated by ' '
        grep cvstag_antares -r ./build.properties | awk '{ print $NF }'


Scripts:
        BEGIN
        starts the running awk code

        END
        ends the running awk code, it should be possible to set
        comments below that (?)
